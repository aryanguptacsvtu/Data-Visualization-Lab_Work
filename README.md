# Data Visualization and Analysis Experiments

## List of Experiments

### 1. House Pricing Dataset Mapping
- Download the House Pricing dataset from Kaggle.
- Map the values to aesthetics using different visualization techniques.

### 2. Rainfall Prediction Dataset - Color Scales
- Use different color scales on the Rainfall Prediction dataset.
- Compare and analyze different color maps for better visual interpretation.

### 3. Bar Plots for Variables
- Create different bar plots for variables in any dataset.
- Customize the visualizations with color coding and annotations.

### 4. Skewed Data and Removal of Skewness
- Show an example of skewed data.
- Demonstrate methods to remove skewness.

### 5. Time Series Visualization
- For a sales dataset, create a time series visualization.
- Use line plots, rolling averages, and trend analysis.

### 6. Scatterplot and Dimension Reduction
- Build a scatterplot to visualize relationships between variables.
- Suggest dimension reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) for better visualization.

### 7. Geospatial Data Projections
- Use geospatial data projections on datasets.
- Utilize resources from GIS in India.

### 8. Trend Line with Confidence Band
- Create a trend line with a confidence band in any suitable dataset.
- Use regression techniques to analyze trends.

### 9. Partial Transparency and Jittering
- Illustrate the use of transparency (alpha blending) in scatter plots.
- Apply jittering to handle overlapping points in categorical data.

### 10. Usage of Different Color Codes
- Demonstrate the usage of different color codes.
